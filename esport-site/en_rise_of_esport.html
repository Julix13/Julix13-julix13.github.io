    <h2>E-sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics: Why this choice?</h2>

    <p>The verdict is out, a new discipline is joining the program for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially confirmed the arrival of E-sports. Despite opposition from critics, this opens wide the doors for these games. Many questions arise from skeptics, as well as from the public. Why this choice? What are the reasons behind it? A look at e-sports in the Olympic program and an overview of the challenges and reluctance surrounding this proposal.</p>

    <h2>E-sports: A Legitimate and Growing Discipline</h2>

    <h3>The Global Rise of Player Audiences</h3>

    <p>11.7 million, that's the number of French fans of e-sports in 2023. E-sports has seen its popularity increase in recent years. This sport includes events or video game tournaments that culminate in regional and international championships, where professional and amateur players compete. Streaming plays a central role in the global rise of the e-sports market. It has become increasingly popular with the significant growth of video gaming, attracting more investors and young talents eager to professionalize this type of sport.</p>
    <p>Moreover, there has been a significant increase in the audience for e-sports events, attracting more viewers than some "traditional" sports. The impact of digital platforms should not be underestimated. Twitch, YouTube, and other platforms have helped e-sports go global, making competitions accessible to everyone, everywhere.</p>

    <h3>Official Recognition of E-sports in Some Countries</h3>

    <p>In France, in 2023, President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his intention to make France "a great e-sports nation and give new momentum to the e-sports strategy for 2020-2025". To this end, a plan was implemented to accelerate its structuring and strengthen its appeal through the hosting of new major international events.</p>
    <p>As a result of this momentum, the three ministries have been conducting consultations for several weeks, bringing together nearly thirty stakeholders. The rise of e-sports worldwide is reflected in various competitions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Asian Games: A multi-sport competition held every 4 years by the Olympic Council of Asia, bringing together athletes from all over Asia.
        </li>
        <li>The Worlds: The annual professional championship tournament for League of Legends, organized by Riot Games. It includes teams from China, Europe, and the United States.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recognition of disciplines such as League of Legends, Fortnite, and Pokémon. We learned that it was in 2018 that the IOC began exploring the potential of e-sports by organizing demonstration events, particularly with Just Dance competitions. Six years later, the IOC took the plunge and officially introduced its arrival. Beyond growing popularity, e-sports carries universal values across the world.</p>

<h3>
  Olympic Values and E-sports
        </h3>
        <p>
          E-sports represent a high-level competition, sharing many values with traditional Olympic disciplines:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellence</li>
        <li>Pushing one’s limits</li>
        <li>Team spirit</li>
        <li>Technical performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, significant changes in equity are emerging within the e-sports world. Many women's teams are flourishing and gaining international recognition. For instance, the Valorant Game Changers Championship brings together ten women's teams from top VALORANT regions (North America, EMEA, APAC, China, Brazil, and Latin America) to compete in this prestigious event.
      </p>
      <p>
      - Eva, a professional Rocket League player, shares her thoughts:
        <i>"This is fantastic news for the gaming world as a whole. It will help people discover what e-sports really are, and for some, it will break stereotypes."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, e-sports, once dominated by male players, are now spotlighting female e-athletes. Inclusivity and accessibility have become the cornerstones of gaming today.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of accessibility, e-sports reach a diverse and global audience, breaking down physical barriers. This inclusivity makes it a unique sport capable of engaging a wide variety of participants.
      </p>
      <h2>
        E-sports at the Olympics: Why Include Them?
      </h2>
      <h3>
        A new boost for Olympic audiences?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is precisely the ambition of IOC President Thomas Bach, who expressed his enthusiasm following the announcement:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"By integrating e-sports, we are celebrating a discipline that captivates young people worldwide and embodies the values of competition and fair play. These Olympics will be the Games of innovation!"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        With millions of fans globally, e-sports have become a mass phenomenon, a trend that accelerated during the Covid era. The e-sports community is increasingly young and connected but also appeals to older generations. Including e-sports in the Olympics could help maintain the Games' appeal to this generation. Moreover, as previously mentioned, the Olympics must adapt to this digital age.
      </p>
      <h3>
        E-sports: Economic and Media Impact
      </h3>
      <p>
        This rapidly growing market generates substantial revenue through advertising, sponsorships, broadcasting rights, and ticket sales. Including e-sports in the Olympics could enhance the Games' economic attractiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partnerships with major tech brands: Companies such as Intel, Samsung, and Nvidia, already deeply involved in e-sports, could provide crucial financial and logistical support for organizing Olympic e-sports competitions.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Challenges and Resistance to E-sports Integration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Critics argue that e-sports do not meet the traditional definition of sport: “a physical activity performed in the spirit of play and effort, requiring methodical training and adherence to rules.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But is this truly the case? Like any sport, e-sports demand daily training and strict adherence to specific rules for each game. Additionally, one could argue it involves a "gymnastics of the mind," requiring intense focus, reflection, and anticipation. This mental strain constitutes a form of physical effort, albeit unconventional compared to sports demanding physical prowess like gymnastics or swimming. Nonetheless, it is no less legitimate. E-sports require genuine physical effort, even if non-traditional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you know more about this new Olympic discipline, from its global recognition to its challenges, e-sports promise to deliver many surprises.
