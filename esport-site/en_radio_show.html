          Rachel Fiori, who came to France for training matches with the French
          team from Montpellier. She agreed to an interview to talk about the
          introduction of e-sports to the Olympics.</strong

      <p>
        M: Hello, welcome to Radio Sunshine today in your new show "Ici ça
        joue," where we will welcome a player from the Italian League of Legends
        team, Rachel Fiori aka StormiNova.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Yes, because if you didn't know, e-sports will be part of the Olympic
        disciplines in 2028 in LA. And we will have a weekly show presenting an
        e-sports player.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: After 6 years of negotiations with the International Olympic
        Committee, e-sports is finally recognized as an Olympic discipline, and
        fans will be able to follow the events on France TV and the
        live-streaming platform Twitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: E-sports fans have reached out on our social media with a FAQ. We
        have selected some questions that we will ask Rachel.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: I think we can welcome her among us, if you're okay with that,
        Juliette.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Yes, of course, Michael, and don’t forget, at the end there will be a
        game where you, dear listeners, can win two tickets for the 2028
        Olympics in Los Angeles. Let’s welcome Rachel now.
      </p>

      <p>Guest jingle</p>

      <p>M + J: Hello Rachel!</p>

      <p>R: Hello!</p>

      <p>
        M: How is everything in Montpellier? Are you enjoying your time with us?
      </p>

      <p>R: Yes, it's going very well, thank you.</p>

      <p>J: You speak very, very good French!</p>

      <p>
        R: Thank you, that’s kind. I come to France often, we do training with
        the French team in Montpellier.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: So you're aware of e-sports entering the Olympics. How do you feel
        about this news?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: It’s great news, we’ve been waiting for this announcement eagerly. I
        hope it will highlight video games and their players.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: We hope so too, Rachel! To know more about you, what game do you
        play?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: I’ve been playing League of Legends for 12 years now. I started
        playing when I was 12, with some friends from school who introduced me
        to the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Can you quickly explain the concept of League of Legends for our
        listeners?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Yes, of course. League of Legends is really the reference game in
        e-sports. Basically, you’re in a team of five players, each with a
        defined role. The games are played on an iconic map, the Summoner’s
        Rift, where you need to use strategy, pure skill, and, most importantly,
        coordination with your teammates to destroy the opposing Nexus.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: You mentioned “pure skill.” Could you explain some specific terms and
        help our listeners?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: So first, skill refers to the abilities I have when playing, like
        knowing how to help teammates.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: In the FAQ, Bertrand asked about some unclear terms in League of
        Legends, like respawn, GL... Can you explain these terms? Or even GL.
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Thanks, Bertrand, for your question. When I respawn with my main, I
        come back to life. And GL means Good Luck.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Regarding mains, we have Delila, a listener who asks what your
        favorite character is.
      </p>

      <p>
        R: So, in League of Legends, we can choose from dozens of champions,
        each with their own abilities and style. It requires a lot of mastery
        because you need to manage your champion, react in real-time to your
        opponents' actions, and adjust your strategies based on the opposing
        team's movements while coordinating with your team. In the gaming world,
        we call the characters we mainly play "mains," and my favorite one to
        play is Ahri.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: You talk about teamwork, how does it go for you in competitions? Do
        you play in a club?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Yes, exactly. I've been in a professional team for 4 years. My team
        is called “i rapaci.” We have 5 members.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: You said you started professionally 4 years ago. Forgive me for
        asking, but did it feel risky to go pro in e-sports?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Yes, unfortunately. It was risky, but I always felt I wasn’t cut out
        for school. I’ve always been happier playing video games, and I finally
        took the leap in 2020. Of course, it was tough at first with my parents,
        who had trouble accepting it, but they saw how happy I was when they
        attended my first competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: And for our last question, we have Michel, who asks how you see
        e-sports after the Olympics? How do you imagine the future of e-sports?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Mhh... Good question. It's certain that e-sports being recognized by
        a major institution like the Olympic Games will change a lot of things
        in this field. We hope it will be watched more and gain credibility
        worldwide. It’s something I really love, and I hope it will finally be
        appreciated for what it truly is after the Olympics.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Thanks for this interview, Rachel, and for opening up to us. We’re
        now going to move on to the second part, which is the game with 3
        listeners.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: 3 people have been randomly selected to answer a small quiz on
        e-sports. All the questions were covered in this interview, to win not 1
        but 2 tickets to Los Angeles to see the events there.
      </p>

      <p>Jingle</p>

      <p>J: Let’s welcome Julie, André, and Thibault.</p>

      <p>
        J: Hello Julie. You’re 22 years old and you live in Nice. What motivated
        you to play this game?
      </p>

      <p>
        Julie: Hello, I’ve been playing video games for years as a hobby. Being
        in a situation of financial instability, I must say that a free trip to
        Los Angeles would be a great opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        J: Thanks, Julie. Your question is: What is the name of the League of
        Legends map?
      </p>

      <p>Julie: World maps?</p>

      <p>
        J: Oh no, unfortunately, it’s wrong. The answer was “Summoner’s Rift”...
      </p>

      <p>Julie: No worries, goodbye.</p>

      <p>
        M: Now let’s move on to Thibault, who is 44 years old and lives in
        Strasbourg. Hello Thibault.
      </p>

      <p>T: Hi team!!</p>

      <p>M: So, Thibault, the question is: What does the term GL mean?</p>

      <p>
        T: Aaaah, I don’t remember. I know “Good Game,” but GL... oh no, I can’t
        recall it. I’ll say Good Game anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: Unfortunately, that’s incorrect! Time’s up, you’ve lost. The answer
        was Good Luck!
      </p>

      <p>T: Oh no, I knew it, but the radio stress got to me.</p>

      <p>
        M: Yes, sometimes it can be tricky. Anyway, we wish you Good Luck in
        your future projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: And now we move on to André, who is 72 years old and lives in
        Mauléon. Hello André.
      </p>

      <p>A: Hello</p>

      <p>
        M: So for this question, Rachel will ask you. But first, we’d like to
        know why you play?
      </p>

      <p>
        A: I play because I’m really curious to see how video games will play
        out in the Olympics, and since there are 2 tickets to win, I’d love to
        take my grandson, who’s a huge fan of video games. He also plays League
        of Legends!
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Hello André, thanks for participating. I’m going to ask you a
        question: What is my main/favorite character, André?
      </p>

      <p>A: Ahri, I think.</p>

      <p>R: That’s right! Congratulations, you win the tickets.</p>

      <p>A: Oh great, my grandson will be so happy.</p>

      <p>M: We wish you a great trip to LA.</p>

      <p>R: Maybe you’ll come to the League of Legends events.</p>

      <p>J: Thanks, André, and goodbye.</p>

      <p>
        J: Finally, we’ve heard about a Netflix documentary series on e-sports.
      </p>

      <p>
        M: Apparently, the series will follow several competitors in preparation
        for the 2028 Olympics. Are you part of it?
      </p>

      <p>
        R: Well, this is the first time I’m giving this information, but yes,
        I’m part of it, no pun intended. There are three Italians being followed
        in their training, and I know there are also some French players
        involved.
      </p>

      <p>M: Can you reveal their names for the French fans?</p>

      <p>
        R: Ah, sorry, I’m not sure I’m allowed to share that. It’s a total
        exclusive! “Haha.”
      </p>

      <p>J: Well, we tried. Let’s close the podcast on this loss.</p>

      <p>M: Thank you, Rachel, and we wish you good luck for the Olympics!</p>

      <p>R: Thank you, it was great.</p>

      <p>
        M: And thanks to you for listening. We’ll see you next week for a
        podcast on our next player: Erick Santos aka Aspas in Valorant.
