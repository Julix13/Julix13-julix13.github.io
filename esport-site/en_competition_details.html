        <h2>Game Summary</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Elden Ring is an action-RPG (Role Playing Game) developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, released on February 25, 2022. 
        Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, with a contribution to the world-building by writer George R. R. Martin, 
        the game immerses players in the Forbidden Lands, an open world rich in myths and dangers.
      </p>

      <p> 
        The concept is based on free exploration of a vast world filled with hostile creatures, hidden secrets, and formidable bosses. 
        The player controls a Tarnished, tasked with restoring the Elden Ring and becoming the Elden Lord by overcoming many challenges, 
        while customizing their playstyle with various weapons, magic, and skills.
      </p>

      <div class="sous-titre">
        <h2>The Olympic Event</h2>
      </div>
  
      <p>
        For this event, several categories are possible for competitors:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Any% Glitchless mode, which requires players not to use game glitches that would make it easier, gives the player the opportunity to use all the resources provided by the game to defeat a series of bosses as quickly as possible, excluding game bugs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second mode involves defeating a series of bosses using Rune L1, meaning players must not upgrade their abilities. After defeating the bosses, competitors must limit themselves to a single item from the boss, and can only use the DLC equipment, so no extras allowed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Players will therefore be evaluated based on the time it takes to defeat a major enemy, and the players with the best times will progress to the next stage.

      Super Smash Bros. is a series of fighting video games created by Masahiro Sakurai and published by Nintendo, 
      starting in 1999 on the Nintendo 64. Unlike traditional fighting games, this series stands out with

    </p>
  
    <p>
      The game features iconic characters from Nintendo franchises (like Mario, Link, Pikachu) as well as guest characters from other 
      video game universes, engaging in dynamic battles on interactive stages. Each installment offers various modes: solo, 
      local or online multiplayer, and competitive tournaments.

  <p>
    The Super Smash Bros. Ultimate event on Nintendo Switch has a qualification phase where teams of three players 
    compete in the gameâ€™s "Barrage" mode, leading to four-minute matches. Barrage mode is a "Team Smash" mode, 
    which involves players choosing their champion. The fighter swap only happens when one of the players loses their character. 
    Additionally, the damage sustained by the other champion doesnâ€™t reset when the champion changes on the other team.
  </p>
  
  <p>The best teams from three matches advance to the next stage. In case of a tie, the winner is decided 
    in another "Team Smash" mode (Relay mode), in a 1v1 with the last player who might not have played.
  </p>
  
  <p> <strong>Relay mode</strong> in Team Smash lets the player choose three (or five) characters to face the opponent. 
  Every time one of the characters on the team is knocked out, they are replaced by another from the pre-chosen list.</p>
  
  <p>
    The winners of the semifinals and finals are decided by the best of 5 matches.

    <p>
      Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter (FPS) developed and published by Riot Games, 
      officially released on June 2, 2020. It combines elements from classic competitive FPS games like Counter-Strike 
      with special hero abilities, similar to games like Overwatch.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In Valorant, two teams of five players compete, alternating between attacking and defending roles. 
      The main objective is to plant or defuse a "spike" (equivalent to a bomb), while using characters 
      called agents, each with unique abilities that add a strategic and dynamic dimension to the game.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    The game is praised for its precise gameplay, well-designed maps, and its growing e-sport scene. 
    Free-to-play, Valorant attracts a large community thanks to regular updates and a progression system based on skins and cosmetic rewards.

    by points and who defuses the opposing team's bomb first.
